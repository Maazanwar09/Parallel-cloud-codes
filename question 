Double the values in a large array of integers using multiple threads. Each 
thread should work on a separate portion of the array. Use OpenMP to: 
 Initialize each thread’s starting index and chunk size 
(using firstprivate). 
 Capture the last processed index for each thread (using lastprivate). 
 Avoid implicit barriers at the end of the parallel region (using nowait).
